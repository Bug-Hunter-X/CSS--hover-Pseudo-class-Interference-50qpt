The following CSS code demonstrates a solution to the problem. By using a more specific selector such as `.parent:hover`, the issue can be resolved.  The parent's hover will now function as expected even when the child element is hovered over.
```css
.parent {
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 10px;
}

.parent:hover {
  background-color: lightblue; 
}

a {
  color: blue;
}

a:hover {
  color: darkblue;
}
```
